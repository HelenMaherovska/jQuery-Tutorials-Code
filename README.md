# jQuery-Tutorials-Code
There is a series of JQuery Tutorials by Derek Banas beginning on

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMxGhHNOkCU with lesson 1.

He does not provide code for this.

I am sharing my code, which shows most of what he does and then some.
For example, in Video 2, he shows various event responses, and 
then he deletes them and writes some others. 

I have changed some of what he does 
(such as using different buttons and panels for the various events)
so that (mostly) each functionality is maintained. 

If  a functioality is not maintained, I comment it out and then 
begin the new functionality in a new block of code after 
'//==========================================='.

It is good to follow his coding as he does it, but he started with 
an html file and does not show all of the scripts an styling part of the file.
That is really the main reason that I began shareing these files, 
as not having all this to start could be very frustrating to those who
want to do the jQ part.
